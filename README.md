## Aim
To create a UiPath workflow that opens Notepad and simulates keyboard typing and shortcuts like saving a file using simulated keystrokes.

## Materials Required
UiPath Studio (Community or Enterprise Edition)

Windows OS

Notepad (built-in Windows app)

Basic knowledge of keyboard automation using UiPath

## Procedure

### Step 1: Create a New Process
Open UiPath Studio and create a new process named KeyboardAutomation.

### Step 2: Open Notepad
Drag and drop Start Process activity.

Set the properties:

FileName: "notepad.exe"

### Step 3: Add Delay (Optional but Recommended)
Add a Delay activity to wait for Notepad to open.

Duration: 00:00:02 (2 seconds)

### Step 4: Use Type Into Activity
Drag and drop a Type Into activity.

Click Indicate on Screen and select the Notepad window.

Text to type:
~~~
Hello! This text is typed by UiPath using keyboard automation.
ðŸ’¡ Enable ClickBeforeTyping and Activate options in the Properties panel for accuracy.
~~~
### Step 5: Use Keyboard Shortcuts (e.g., Save)
Drag and drop a Send Hotkey activity.
Indicate the same Notepad window.
Set the key to Ctrl + S (hold Ctrl, then choose S).

### Step 6: Type File Name and Press Enter
Add a Type Into activity to type file name (e.g., MyFile.txt).
Add another Send Hotkey for pressing Enter.
